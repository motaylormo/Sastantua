# Sastantua
For me, `Sastantua` was the most emotionally charged project of the **[42 piscine](https://www.42.us.org/)**. I spent the whole day (July 29, 2018) working on it, and I _got it working_ by afternoonâ€”in one super-long function full of for loops. Then, as I tried to corset it into the norme, I broke it, ran out of time, and started crying.

A year later, as a piscine prefect (July 12, 2019), I decided to do Sastantua again and vanquish it.
