# Sastantua
For me, `Sastantua` was the most emotionally charged project of the **[42 piscine](https://www.42.us.org/)**. I got it working by afternoonâ€”in one super-long function full of for loops. Then, as I tried to corset it into the norme, I broke it, ran out of time, and started crying. A year later, as a prefect for piscine, I decided to do Sastantua againa and vanqush it.
